XO (Tic Tac Toe) is a simple game between two players, each choosing to be "X" or "O." Playing by suit, each player places their token in a 3x3 grid.
The goal is to line up three or more tokens visually, vertically, or diagonally to win. If all the boxes are filled and there is no winner, the result is a draw. 
The game operates in text mode, and players write a number from 1 to 9 to determine their playing position. 
After each move, the game indirectly determines whether a win or a draw will occur.
